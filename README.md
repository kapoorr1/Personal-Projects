# Personal Projects
Hi, there ðŸ‘‹ ! This repository contains a collection of my personal projects. Please note that many of these repositories are set to private to preserve the integrity of course assignments. However, they are available upon request. Thank you for understanding!

## Project List

1. **[budget-app](https://github.com/kapoorr1/budget-app):** Designed and developed a budgeting application that enables users to manage their spending by categorizing expenses, such as shopping, food, and fuel.

2. **[p00-person201](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p00-person201):** This project utilizes a Person201 class to manage student data in CS201. It includes details like name, dorm, and floor, and provides a list of students matching a given search query.

3. **[p01-nbody](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p01-nbody):** This simulation project involves celestial bodies such as planets and suns interacting based on initial positions and masses provided in a data file. The simulation runs over a defined time period and includes animation of the interactions.

4. **[p02-markov](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p02-markov):** Using the Markov model, this project generates random text resembling a given training text. It generates words one by one, determining each subsequent word based on the probabilities of the previous word in the training text.

5. **[p03-dnalinkstrand](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p03-dnalinkstand):** This project simulates DNA restriction enzyme cleaving using a linked list structure. It models recombinant DNA and the cutting process.

6. **[p04-autocomplete](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p04-autocomplete):** Implementing the autocomplete algorithm, this project assists users by suggesting relevant terms that match a search query effectively.

7. **[p05-huffman](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p05-huffman):** This project implements the Huffman algorithm to compress or decompress a stream of input bits efficiently.

8. **[p06-route](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p06-route):** Utilizing Djikstraâ€™s algorithm, this project creates an application that calculates the shortest route between two US cities. The route combines roads and interstates for optimal navigation.

9. **[p07-assembly](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p07-assembly):** This project uses the MIPS assembly language to sort and print different building efficiencies. A linked list data structure is implemented to accomplish this task.

10. **[p08-vendingmachine](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p08-vendingmachine):** This project utilizes a Moore machine design to construct a vending machine in Logisim that uses combinational logic gates.

11. **[p09-cpu](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p09-cpu):** This project implements a 16-bit word-addressed RISC architecture CPU within Logisim. The CPU is designed to interpret instructions in the MIPS assembly language, manage data through 8 registers, and execute operations using an ALU and control unit.

12. **[p10-cachesim](https://github.com/kapoorr1/p10-cachesim):** This project simulates a write-through, write-no-allocate cache in C.

13. **[p11-nyt](https://github.com/kapoorr1/ios101-capstone-project):** This app uses the New York Times API to retrieve the top stories currently on the NYT homepage. Users can select an article to view more details about it and bookmark the article to read at a later time.

Feel free to explore these projects for a better understanding of my work!
